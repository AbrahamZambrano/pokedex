# pokedex

I am introducing my Pokédex, an electronic encyclopedia that gathers information about different Pokémon species. My goal is to provide trainers with a useful and user-friendly tool to obtain details about the Pokémon they encounter on their journey. The Pokédex includes a database with information such as names, types, abilities, combat statistics, and evolutions.

If you want to test, you only need to download the code and do this command:

      - ng serve --o
